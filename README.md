# SQL Exercises

### Purpose

The objective of this repository is to keep track of the SQL exercises completed alongside the Khan Academy lessons given 
through the Flatiron Data Science post-work curriculum.

### Organization

Notebooks will be added based on the lessons ans exercises being practiced as I go to the program. The plan is to do the inital
